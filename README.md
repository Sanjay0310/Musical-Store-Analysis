# Musical-Store-Analysis

I'm excited to share my latest SQL project: a comprehensive analysis of a music store database. This project involved examining sales patterns, customer behavior, genre popularity, and artist performance to extract valuable business insights. Key findings include identifying top-performing markets, recognizing long-serving employees, and uncovering customer preferences across regions. Using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4, I transformed raw data into actionable intelligence that can improve inventory management, enhance customer experience, and boost overall revenue.
